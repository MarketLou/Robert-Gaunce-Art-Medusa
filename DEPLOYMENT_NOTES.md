## Current Sprint: Railway Deployment Stabilization

### Issue #1: Admin Dashboard Build Failure (CRITICAL)
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Date Identified**: October 30, 2025  
**Severity**: Critical - Service Unable to Start

#### Problem Description
The Railway deployment was failing with the error:
```
Could not find index.html in the admin build directory. 
Make sure to run 'medusa build' before starting the server.
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Railway was not executing a build command before starting the server
2. The `npm start` command was running immediately without building the admin dashboard
3. Medusa v2.11 requires `npm run build` to compile the admin UI, not `npx medusa admin build`
4. Without the build step, the `/app/.medusa/admin/index.html` file was never created

#### Solution Implemented
**Files Changed:**
- Created `railway.json` with explicit build configuration

**Configuration Details:**
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

**What This Does:**
- Tells Railway to run `npm install && npm run build` during the build phase
- The build command compiles TypeScript and builds the admin dashboard UI
- Creates the required `/app/.medusa/admin/index.html` file
- Then starts the server with `npm start`

**Commit**: `c36cd39` - "Fix Railway deployment: add build config and integrate Redis/S3 modules"

### Issue #2: Redis Connection Failure (CRITICAL)
**Status**: ⚠️ PENDING USER ACTION  
**Date Identified**: October 30, 2025  
**Severity**: Critical - Production Instability

#### Problem Description
The Medusa service was unable to connect to the dedicated Railway Redis instance, falling back to unstable in-memory storage:
```
Local Event Bus installed. This is not recommended for production.
Locking module: Using "in-memory" as default.
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. The `REDIS_URL` environment variable in Railway contained a corrupted value
2. Trailing double-quotes were present: `${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}?family=0""`
3. This caused Redis connection failures
4. Medusa fell back to in-memory storage (unstable for production)

#### Solution Required
**Action Required in Railway Dashboard:**

Navigate to: **Railway Dashboard → Service → Variables → REDIS_URL**

**Current Value (Incorrect):**
```
${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}?family=0""
```

**Change To (Correct):**
```
${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}?family=0
```

**What This Fixes:**
- Removes the extraneous trailing double-quotes
- Allows Medusa to properly connect to Railway's Redis instance
- Enables stable session caching, event processing, and background jobs
- Eliminates "in-memory" warnings in production logs

**Status**: Awaiting manual fix in Railway dashboard

### Issue #3: Module Integration (Redis, S3, Stripe)
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED (Redis & S3), ⏳ DEFERRED (Stripe)  
**Date Identified**: October 30, 2025  
**Severity**: High - Production Features Missing

#### Problem Description
The `medusa-config.ts` file was not registering essential production modules:
- Redis cache/event-bus/workflow-engine modules
- S3 file storage module
- Stripe payment provider

Without these modules registered, the services couldn't be used even when environment variables were configured.

#### Solution Implemented
**Files Changed:**
- Updated `medusa-config.ts` to include `modules` array

**Modules Added:**

1. **Redis Cache Module**
   ```typescript
   {
     resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/cache-redis",
     options: { redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL }
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Caches database queries and API responses
   - **Benefit**: Improves performance and reduces database load

2. **Redis Event Bus Module**
   ```typescript
   {
     resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/event-bus-redis",
     options: { redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL }
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Handles asynchronous event processing
   - **Benefit**: Ensures reliable event delivery across services

3. **Redis Workflow Engine Module**
   ```typescript
   {
     resolve: "@medusajs/medusa/workflow-engine-redis",
     options: { redis: { url: process.env.REDIS_URL } }
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Manages background jobs and workflows
   - **Benefit**: Enables order processing, email notifications, etc.

4. **S3 File Storage Module**
   ```typescript
   {
     resolve: "@medusajs/file-s3",
     options: {
       file_url: process.env.S3_URL,
       access_key_id: process.env.S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
       secret_access_key: process.env.S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
       region: process.env.S3_REGION,
       bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET,
       endpoint: process.env.S3_ENDPOINT,
       additional_client_config: { forcePathStyle: true }
     }
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose**: Stores product images and media files
   - **Provider**: DigitalOcean Spaces (S3-compatible)
   - **Benefit**: Scalable, reliable file storage separate from application server

**Stripe Payment Module:**
- **Status**: Deferred to payment implementation phase
- **Reason**: Package name/version for Medusa v2.11 requires research
- **Will Add**: When payment processing is required

**Commit**: `c36cd39` - "Fix Railway deployment: add build config and integrate Redis/S3 modules"

## Known Issues & Warnings

### Non-Critical Warnings
These warnings appear in logs but don't prevent operation:

1. **"npm warn config production Use `--omit=dev` instead"**
   - **Impact**: None - just a deprecation notice
   - **Action**: Can be ignored for now

2. **"Skipping instrumentation registration. No register function found."**
   - **Impact**: None - optional observability feature
   - **Action**: Can be ignored unless monitoring is needed

3. **Line ending warnings (LF vs CRLF)**
   - **Impact**: None - Git automatically handles conversion
   - **Action**: Can be ignored

---

## Success Criteria

The deployment will be considered stable and successful when:

1. ✅ Build completes without errors
2. ✅ Server starts without crashes
3. ✅ Redis connection succeeds (no "in-memory" fallback)
4. ✅ Admin dashboard is accessible at `/app`
5. ✅ API health check returns 200 OK
6. ✅ S3 storage is active and functional
7. ✅ No crash loops or restart cycles
